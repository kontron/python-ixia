"""
IxTclHalApi - API of the Ixia TCL HAL server
--------------------------------------------

There are several layers of indirections:

- The hardware itself.
- The IxHal API which controls the hardware, there seems to be a ixhal.dll
  which is used on windows to access this API directly.
- The IxTclHal API which is provided by a TclServer, which in turn uses the
  IxHal API.
- The TCL script which uses the IxTclHal API.

The TclServer provides an ASCII interface (port 4555) where you can use the TCL
commands. See :mod:`pyixia.tclproto` for more information on the protocol. This
server also serves as a temporary storage for the properties you set. There are
different commands to set properties and transfer them between the layers.

The `config` and `cget` commands are used to store and retrieve values from the
temporary storage within the TclServer. The `set` and `get` commands are used
to transfer this values between the TclServer and the IxHal layer. `set` writes
data from the TclServer to the IxHal layer and `get` fetches data from the
IxHal to the temporary storage of the TclServer. And last, `write` actually
commits the data from IxHal to the hardware. `refresh` moves the data from the
hardware to IxHal.

For example, if you like to set the port speed:

- port config -speed 10
- port set <chassis ID> <card ID> <port ID>
- port write <chassis ID> <card ID> <port ID>

Note that there is only one temporary storage for each command.

    If no attribute name is given, it is derived from the tclMemberName by
    replacing every uppercase letter with the lowercase variant prepended with
